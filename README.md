# Killer-Button-Xwidget

A FOSS Kill Gauge VB6 Widget for Reactos, XP, Win7, 8 and 10+.

This widget is now deprecated and is retained for historical reasons only, it still works but time moves ever onward - please use the VB6 version instead that you will find here: https://github.com/yereverluvinunclebert/Panzer-Kill-gauge-VB6

The Panzer Kill Gauge VB6 gauge is a simple utility displaying a process kill Gauge in a dieselpunk fashion on your desktop. It can be resized and placed anywhere on your desktop. It uses minimal resources and helps give your desktop a dieselpunk make-over.

I keep it in very small size, top right on my screen, ready for use.

I use it to kill a wayward process. I used to run a lot of Yahoo Widgets and occasionally the Konfabulator engine would get itself in a twist and start continually dying/reloading. I had this exact widget on my desktop (written in MS Jscript for the Xwidget engine) and whenever YWE did a 'funny' I would dblClick on the Kill button and YWE would die. When you are developing it is not unsusual to create a rogue program that needs to be killed regularly. Use this tool to do it. 

Created for XP, Vista, Win7, 8, 10+ as well as the Apple Mac/Linux with Wine.

This Panzer widget is an attractive dieselpunk Xwidget for your desktop. It is a simple drive storage gauge. It can handle A or B floppy drives if they exist as well as hard drives. Responds quickly to controls and a fix to calculate the drive capacity measurements. Functional and gorgeous at the same time. This Widget is a moveable widget that you can move anywhere around the desktop as you require.

I created for the World of Tanks and War Thunder communities. The graphics are my own, I took original inspiration from a clock face by Italo Fortana.

To find out how the widget operates, simply right click and select Help and a full explanation of all the buttons, windows is shown. The top left window is the current power in digital form. Hovering over any control should supply a pop-up explaining each function.

The widget can be resized - Hover the cursor over the widget. Press the CTRL key and use your mousewheel up or down. The widget will resize dynamically.

Right clicking will bring up a menu of options. Double-clicking on the widget will cause a personalised Windows application to fire up. The first time you run it there will be no assigned function and so it will state as such and then pop up the preferences so that you can enter the command of your choice. The widget takes command line-style commands for windows.

This widget is a virtual duplicate of the Yahoo widget Panzer storage widget that 
you can find here: https://github.com/yereverluvinunclebert/Panzer-Storage-Gauge-Ywidget
The graphic interface and operation of the two types of widgets are the same. The 
only differences are the configuration preference utility (this has a cut-down 
version), the language is Micrososoft's JScript (rather than javascript) and it is the Xwidget engine that is utilised to put the widget on your screen.

This widget is uploaded here for historical archival reasons. I suggest that you 
use the Yahoo widget version as it is a superior engine for developing widgets. 
I will provide bugfixes for the Yahoo widget version but NOT for Xwidgets.

All Jscript widgets need an engine to function, in this case the widget uses 
the XWidget engine. The engine interprets the Jscript and creates the widget 
according to the XML description and using the images you provide.
